Pretzels


Recipe mostly from Jefferey Hamelman, but with the poaching solution from
America's Test Kitchen.

Pretzels:
1000g AP flour
20g salt
6g instant yeast
50g butter
540g water (body temperature)

Mix the dry ingredients, lightly cut in the butter, add the water.  Mix
together into a solid dough (it will be very dry; much tougher than a regular
bread dough) and knead into a cohesive mass.  Let sit for 20 minutes in the
bowl, covered with a wet tea towel.  Knead for another few minutes into a
smooth ball.  Cover again and let double in size, roughly 2 hours.  Divide into
18 pretzels at 90g each. (You can fit 9 pretzels on a half-sheet pan.) Let
pretzels proof for 30 minutes.  While waiting for the pretzels, preheat oven to
450F and bring 1L of water + 1/4c baking soda to boil in a large pot.  With the
water at a simmer, add a few pretzels at a time for 30-40s, flipping halfway
through.  Remove back to the tray with a slotted spoon or spider to drain.
Sprinkle with salt.  Bake for 15 minutes.  With 5 minutes left on the first
tray, start boiling the second tray of pretzels.
