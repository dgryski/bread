A local bakery had a Turkish flat bread that was delicious but expensive.  This
is my replacement.

600g AP flour
480g water
12g salt
4g yeast

This is a very sticky dough due to the hydration. Mix dough, rest 20 minutes,
fold, rest 15, fold.  Let proof 90 minutes.  "Shape" (pour) onto a lined baking
sheet.  Let proof 30 minutes.  Drizzle with olive oil and generously cover with
za'atar.  Bake 20m @ 435F.
