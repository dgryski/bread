This is my standard enriched white dough.  I use it for sweet things like fruit
breads, cinnamon rolls, and hot cross buns.

I've actually seen enriched dough recipes with values for the sugar/butter/egg
percents anywhere from 8% to 25%, so feel free to experiment.  Going much
higher than 25% will lead you into brioche territory. Note that you'll need to
lower the water percentage to account for the additional liquid from the egg
and butter.  For hydration purposes, 75% of an egg counts towards hydration,
and 20% of the butter (15% if using European butter). The 10/10/10 dough then
has roughly 53.5% + 0.75 * 10% + 0.2 * 10% = 63% hydration.

100% AP
2% salt
1% instant yeast
10% sugar
10% butter
10% egg
5.35% dry milk solids
53.5% water

For slightly less enriched dough that's nice for hamburger buns, I use the
following:

100% AP
2% salt
1% instant yeast
5% sugar
5% butter
5% dry milk solids
65% water

Scale to 95g and bake for 20 minute @ 425F.
