This is my standard enriched white dough.  I use it for sweet things like fruit
breads, cinnamon rolls, and hot cross buns.

100% AP
2% salt
1% instant yeast
10% sugar
10% butter
10% egg
5.35% dry milk solids
53.5% water

For slightly less enriched dough that's nice for hamburger buns, I use the
following:

100% AP
2% salt
1% instant yeast

5% butter
5% dry milk solids

Scale to 95g and bake for 20 minute @ 425F.
