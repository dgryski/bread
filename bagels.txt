Montreal-style bagels.

I lived in Montreal for 6 years, so these are the bagels I want to eat.  The
recipe claims to be the St-Viateur recipe (via
http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/13104/montral-style-bagels), and matches very
closely with the same claimed recipe derived from an independent source (
https://www.thenewburgundians.com/montreal-style-bagels/ )

Mix dough; it's stiff. You can probably give it a 15-minute rest to let the
dough hydrate a bit before finishing kneading.  Let the dough proof 45 minutes,
then divide into 95-100g pieces.  Shape into bagels and prepare poaching
solution (2L water + 1/4c=50g brown sugar or honey).  Poach for 3 minutes,
flipping halfway.  Coat with sesame or poppy seeds.  Bake at 460F for 20
minutes.
