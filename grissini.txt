Grissini (Italian olive-oil breadsticks)

100% flour
52% water
12% olive oil
10% butter
2% salt
0.66% IDY

Due to the amount of oil and butter, the dough will be very soft.

After bulk ferment, roll out into a large rectangle, dust with sesame seeds,
and cut out thin strips with a pizza wheel and a straight-edge.  The grissini
need no further proofing and can be baked after shaping.

Bake at 380F for 20 minutes.
