When I need to make traditional round pizzas to bake on a pizza stone, this is
my recipe.

100% AP flour
65% water
1% yeast
2% salt
2% sugar
2% oil

But most of the time I make this. 500g of flour nicely fills on one 18x13" half
sheet pan.

90% AP flour 
10% WW flour
75% water
2% salt
0.6% instant yeast

After proofing, shape onto an oiled sheet pan.  Let rest while your prep the
toppings. Bake 20m @ 435F.
